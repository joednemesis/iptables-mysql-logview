For a larger network I would like to create several security zones by several internal iptables firewalls. The configuration of the individual firewalls is to be done with the fwbuilder.

What is still missing is a central logging, so that even inexperienced can quickly find an error in the rules

The central logging should be done with ulogd2 in a mysql database. In this project an easy-to-use web interface is to be created.
